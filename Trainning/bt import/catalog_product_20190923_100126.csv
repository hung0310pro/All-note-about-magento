DEM-432XT,,Default,simple,"Default Category/Products/Computers & Accessories/Networking and Connectivity/Transceivers and Converters",base,"D-link 10GBase-LR SFP+ Transceiver - 10km","<p>D-Link’s 10G SFP+ Module series are hot-swappable SFP+ transceivers that plug into SFP+ slots on switches and support 10G Ethernet. The D-Link 10GBASE SFP+ Module Series transceivers offer a wide variety of 10G Ethernet connectivity options for data centres, enterprise wiring closets, and service provider transport applications. </p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Small Form-factor Pluggable Format</strong> </p>
<p>The transceivers use the Enhanced Small Form-factor Pluggable format (SFP+). The SFP+ form factor is smaller than other form factors such as Xenpak, X2, and 10G XFP, ensuring lower costs, lower power disruption, and higher port density. They provide the necessary signal amplification for data to be transmitted to the network cable from the port, and vice versa, for the port to receive data from the network cable.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Pluggable</strong> <br /><br />All D-Link transceivers are hot-pluggable. You can connect a transceiver while the system is powered on without causing any problems. This permits modules to be added or removed without interrupting the network. </p>
<p><strong>10G Ethernet speeds</strong> <br /><br />The transceivers all support 10G Ethernet, which results in very fast data transmissions of up to 10 Gbit/s. This is 10 times faster than Gigabit Ethernet and enables the switch to handle faster and higher data transmissions, making it very suitable for business needs.  </p>

<div><strong>Enhanced Small Form-factor Pluggable Format</strong></div>
<p><br />The transceivers use the Enhanced Small Form-factor Pluggable format (SFP+). The SFP+ form factor is smaller than other form factors such as Xenpak, X2, and 10G XFP, ensuring lower costs, lower power disruption, and higher port density. They provide the necessary signal amplification for data to be transmitted to the network cable from the port, and vice versa, for the port to receive data from the network cable.</p>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Hot Pluggable</strong></div>
<p><br />All D-Link transceivers are hot-pluggable. You can connect a transceiver while the system is powered on without causing any problems. This permits modules to be added or removed without interrupting the network.</p>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>10G Ethernet speeds<br /></strong><br />The transceivers all support 10G Ethernet, which results in very fast data transmissions of up to 10 Gbit/s. This is 10 times faster than Gigabit Ethernet and enables the switch to handle faster and higher data transmissions, making it very suitable for business needs.</p>

DEM-433XT,,Default,simple,"Default Category/Products/Computers & Accessories/Networking and Connectivity/Transceivers and Converters",base,"D-Link 10GBase-ER SFP+ Transceiver (Single Mode 1515nm) - 40km","<p>D-Link’s 10G SFP+ Module series are hot-swappable SFP+ transceivers that plug into SFP+ slots on switches and support 10G Ethernet. The D-Link 10GBASE SFP+ Module Series transceivers offer a wide variety of 10G Ethernet connectivity options for data centres, enterprise wiring closets, and service provider transport applications. 

<p><strong>Enhanced Small Form-factor Pluggable Format</strong> </p>
<p>The transceivers use the Enhanced Small Form-factor Pluggable format (SFP+). The SFP+ form factor is smaller than other form factors such as Xenpak, X2, and 10G XFP, ensuring lower costs, lower power disruption, and higher port density. They provide the necessary signal amplification for data to be transmitted to the network cable from the port, and vice versa, for the port to receive data from the network cable. </p>

<p><strong>Hot Pluggable</strong> </p>
<p>All D-Link transceivers are hot-pluggable. You can connect a transceiver while the system is powered on without causing any problems. This permits modules to be added or removed without interrupting the network. </p>
<p><strong>10G Ethernet speeds</strong> </p>
The transceivers all support 10G Ethernet, which results in very fast data transmissions of up to 10 Gbit/s. This is 10 times faster than Gigabit Ethernet and enables the switch to handle faster and higher data transmissions, making it very suitable for business needs. </p>

<p><strong>Versatile Management </strong></p>
<p>The DGS-1510 Series supports virtual stacking via D-Link’s Single IP Management (SIM), allowing up to 32 devices to be managed through a single IP address. This simplifies management of small workgroups or wiring closets while significantly reducing the number of IP addresses needed to manage your network. The DGS-1510 Series provides the D-Link Network Assistant (DNA) utility and a web-based management interface that enables administrators to easily set up and remotely manage their networks, greatly reducing switch deployment time. The DGS-1510 Series also features an extensive Command Line Interface (CLI) and SNMP support, allowing centralized management of a large number of devices. Out-of-band management of the switches is also available via a designated console port. This provides access to devices in the event that there is a loss of connectivity or that the switch is overloaded with bulk or malicious traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Efficient </strong></p>
<p>All of the DGS-1510 Series switches are capable of conserving power without sacrificing operational performance or functionality thanks to D-Link Green 3.0 technology. Using the IEEE 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) standard, the network will automatically decrease power usage when traffic is low. For environments that do not fully support this standard, these switches offer advanced power-saving settings including port shut-off, LED shut-off, and system hibernation based on custom profiles. These profiles can also be applied to the PoE switches so that there is no unnecessary power consumption during off-hours.</p>

Switch management can be performed through a web management interface or through the SmartConsole Utility. A fanless design allows for quieter operation and provides a longer product life. The DGS-1100-08P provides an affordable solution for Small and Medium Business, and for communities without IT staff. They are also suitable for enterprise deployment, such as in branch offices and meeting rooms that require simple network management.</p>
<p><strong>Surveillance VLAN and Bandwidth Control</strong></p>
<p>The DGS-1100-08P supports Surveillance VLAN, which is best suited for video surveillance deployment. Surveillance VLAN is a new, industry leading technology that consolidates data and surveillance video transmission through a single DGS-1100 switch, thus sparing businesses the expense of dedicated hardware and facilities. Surveillance VLAN also ensures the quality of real-time video for monitoring and control without compromising the transmission of conventional network data. In addition, with Bandwidth Control, network administrators can reserve bandwidth for important functions that require more bandwidth or might have high priority.</p>
<p><strong>PoE Support</strong></p>
<p>The DGS-1100-08P delivers Power over Ethernet (PoE) capabilities, making deployment with IP cameras, VoIP phones, and access points much easier. Power cords will become a thing of the past, as the DGS-1100-08P complies with the 802.3af standard for PoE and supports a 64 Watt power budget. The 10/100/1000Base-T Ethernet ports mean that even high-quality video is no problem.</p>
<p><strong>Easy to deploy</strong></p>
<p>The DGS-1100 Smart Managed Switches support an intuitive SmartConsole utility and a web-based management interface that enables administrators to remotely control their network down to the port level. The SmartConsole allows customers to discover multiple D-Link Smart Switches within the same L2 network segment. With this utility, users do not need to change the IP address of their PC, and this also makes initial setup of the Smart Switches quick and easy.

<li>Fanless design for quiet operation</li>
<li>User friendly Web interface</li>
<li>Advanced networking features for SMB</li>
</ul>
<p>The DGS-1100-05PD is a unique 5-port switch powered through the network cable by an upstream PoE power source (PoE switch or injector). As a “PoE extender”, it also has the ability to propagate (pass-through) PoE power further downstream to one or two Powered Devices (PDs). It comes in a compact desktop-sized metal case with fanless design for silent operation. Advanced management features, diagnostic and troubleshooting tools, and energy efficient technologies provide a flexible solution to suit your networking requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Powered by PoE</strong></p>
<p>The DGS-1100-05PD is powered by a PoE switch or PoE injector that can be located up to 100m away. As such, this device is intended for applications where a small 5-port Gigabit switch is required but AC power is not close by. The upstream PoE source may support either 802.3af or 802.3at. One switch port is used for the power input (port 5) and the other four ports are available as standard 10/100/1000 ports for networked devices, such as PCs, printers, etc.</p>
<p><strong>PoE Extender</strong></p>
<p>The DGS-1100-05PD switch can also “pass-through” PoE power to one or two downstream PDs (such as IP Cameras, IP Phones, Wireless APs). The PoE pass-through capability makes the DGS-1100-05PD ideal for IP Surveillance networks when cameras are located beyond 100m from the main PoE switch. As an additional benefit, because the switch is smart-managed, an administrator can control various PoE functions through the user interface, such as remotely rebooting cameras or access points, from anywhere on the network.</p>
<p><strong>Auto Surveillance/Voice VLAN and Bandwidth Control</strong></p>
<p>The DGS-1100-05PD supports Auto Surveillance VLAN (ASV) which ensures the quality of real-time video for monitoring and control without compromising the transmission of conventional network data. The DGS-1100-05PD also supports Auto Voice VLAN, which is best suited for VoIP deployments. This enhances the VoIP service by automatically placing voice traffic from an IP phone to an assigned VLAN. With higher priority and individual VLAN, these features guarantee the quality and security of VoIP traffic. Bandwidth Control can reserve bandwidth on a per port basis for important functions that require larger bandwidth or have high priority.</p>
<p><strong>Built to Last</strong></p>
<p>The DGS-1100-05PD comes in a compact metal enclosure. It can be wall mounted or placed on a desktop. It has no fans so it operates silently. Compliant with IEEE 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE), it consumes less energy by cutting down on power consumption when port utilization is low.</p>

</ul>
<p>The DWL-8710AP is an outdoor dual-band Wireless AC1200 Access Point designed specifically for deployment in business and campus environments. The DWL-8710AP can be installed on a wall or pole with the included mounting brackets. The DWL-8710AP is IP67-compliant and is designed to operate in harsh outdoor environments. For easy installation, it has integrated 802.3at Power over Ethernet (PoE) support, allowing installation of this device in areas where power outlets are not readily available. Highly manageable and capable of blazing speeds, the DWL-8710AP integrates seamlessly into existing network infrastructure and can be easily scaled to meet future demands.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Reach and Flexibility</strong></p>
<p>The DWL-8710AP provides unparalleled connectivity by using a 2x2 antenna implementation, allowing high combined data rates of 1167 Mbps (AC867 Mbps + N300 Mbps) over the air. Beamforming technology enables the DWL-8710AP to have even greater reach than its predecessor, allowing even more flexibility in any deployment scenario. With the 802.11c technology, the DWL-8710AP provides high performance over two bands, so wireless clients can stream media faster and farther than before using existing devices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Centrally Manage your Wireless Network</strong></p>
<p>When working in conjunction with D-Link Unified Switches/Controllers, the DWL-8710AP can be centrally managed. This allows for a large number of APs to be deployed and managed easily and efficiently. Once the APs are discovered by the switch/controller, the administrator can push specific configuration sets onto them rather than having to do so individually. In addition, RF resource management and security are also managed centrally, allowing the administrator to pre-emptively identify potential deficiencies and weaknesses in the network.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Self-Configuring Cluster</strong></p>
<p>For small businesses that need to deploy multiple APs but lack the resources to tackle the complicated task of network management, the DWL-8710AP’s self-configuring cluster feature offers the ideal solution. When a small number of DWL-8710APs are deployed on the network, they may be configured to form a self-configuring cluster. Once the administrator configures one access point, the same configuration can then be applied to all remaining APs. Up to 8 APs may be used to form a cluster, making setting up your business wireless network a breeze.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Upgraded for Superior Performance</strong></p>
<p>The DWL-8710AP features a more powerful CPU, giving it a performance boost over its predecessor. The external high gain omnidirectional antennas increase its reach, eliminating dead spots and filling hard to reach places. Bandsteering technology enables the AP to balance the load between its two radios rather than forcing all users onto the 2.4 GHz band, allowing for smooth streaming of video, instant transmission of SMS and e-mail, and fast downloads for mobile devices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Automatic RF Management</strong></p>
<p>When a number of access points are deployed close to each other, interference may result if proper RF management isn’t implemented. When a DWL-8710AP senses a neighbour nearby, it will automatically select a noninterfering channel. This greatly reduces RF interference and will allow the administrator to deploy APs more densely. To further minimize interference, when a nearby AP is operating on the same channel, the DWL-8710AP will automatically lower its transmission power2. When, for whatever reason, the nearby AP is no longer present, the DWL-8710AP will increase its transmission power to expand coverage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Quality of Service</strong></p>
<p>The DWL-8710AP supports 802.1p Quality of Service (QoS) for enhanced throughput and better performance of time-sensitive traffic like VoIP and streaming DSCP. The DWL-8710AP is WMM-certified, so in the event of network congestion, time-sensitive traffic can be given priority ahead of other traffic. Furthermore, when a number of DWL-8710AP units are in close proximity to each other, an access point will refuse new association requests once its resources are fully utilized, allowing the association request to be picked up by a neighbouring unit. This feature ensures that no single AP is overburdened while others nearby sit idle.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Maximum wireless signal rate derived from IEEE standard 802.11 and draft 802.11ac specifications. Actual data throughput will vary. Network conditions and environmental factors, including volume of network traffic, building materials and construction, and network overhead, lower actual data throughput rate. Environmental factors will adversely affect wireless signal range. <br /> <br /> <sup>2 </sup>This feature is available when Unified AP is used in conjunction with D-Link’s line of Unified Wireless Switches/controllers.</p>

<p>Unified Wireless AC1750 Dual Band Concurrent Access Point for DWS-3160, DWS-4026, DWC-1000, DWC-2000</p>
<ul>
<li>802.11ac wireless technology</li>
<li>Concurrent 2.4GHz and 5GHz dualband</li>
<li>3x3 antenna design for 2.4GHz and 5GHz</li>
<li>Up to 1720Mbps throughput</li>
<li>Two Gigabit LAN ports</li>
<li>PoE+ support (802.3at)</li>
<li>Beamforming and Bandsteering technologies</li>
<li>Standalone and controller managed operation</li>
</ul>
<p>The DWL-8610AP is D-Link’s next generation Unified Wireless Access Point. Intended for the small/medium enterprise market, the DWL-8610AP provides unparalleled bandwidth and flexibility for administrators looking to deploy a medium/large scale Wi-Fi network. Featuring the latest 802.11ac technology on its 5GHz band, the DWL-86100AP brings you to the forefront in cutting edge wireless technology.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Reach and Flexibility</strong></p>
<p>The DWL-8610AP provides unparalled connectivity by using 3x3 implementation, allowing for over 1 Gbps of throughput over the air. Beamforming technology enables the DWL-8610AP to have even greater reach than its predecessor, the DWL-86100, thereby allowing even more flexibility in any deployment scenario. Based on 3x3 802.11n technology, the DWL-8610AP provides the highest possible level of performance in the 2.4GHz band.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Centrally Manage your Wireless Network</strong></p>
<p>When working in conjunction with D-Link Unified Switch/Controllers, the DWL-8610AP, like other UAPs in the product line, may be centrally managed. This allows a large number of APs to be deployed and managed easily and efficiently. Once the APs are discovered by the switch/controller, the administrator can push specific set of configurations onto them, rather than having to do so one by one. In addition, RF resource management and security are also managed centrally, thus allowing the administrator to pre-emptively identify potential deficiencies and weaknesses in the network.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Self-Configuring Cluster</strong></p>
<p>For small businesses that need to deploy multiple APs but lack the resources to tackle the complicated task of network management, the DWL-8610AP’s self-configuring cluster feature offers the ideal solution. When a small number of DWL-8610APs are deployed on the network, they may be configured to form a self-configuring cluster. Once the administrator configures one access point, the same configuration can then be applied to all remaining APs. Up to 16 APs may be used to form a cluster, making setting up your business wireless network a breeze.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Upgraded for Superior Performance</strong></p>
<p>The DWL-8610AP features a more powerful CPU, giving it a performance boost over its predecessor. The high gain internal omni-directional antenna increases its reach, eliminating dead spots and filling hard to reach places. Bandsteering technology enables the AP to balance the load between its two radios, rather than having all users crowd into the 2.4GHz band allowing for smooth streaming of video, instant SMS and emails and fast downloads on mobile devices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Automatic RF Management</strong></p>
<p>When a number of access points are deployed close to each other, interference may result if proper RF management isn’t implemented. When a DWL-8610AP senses a neighbor nearby, it will automatically select a noninterfering channel. This greatly reduces RF interference and will allow the administrator to deploy APs more densely. To further minimize interference, when a nearby AP is operating on the same channel, the DWL-8610AP will automatically lower its transmission power. When, for whatever reason, the nearby AP is no longer present, the DWL-8610AP will increase its transmission power to expand coverage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Quality of Service</strong></p>
<p>The DWL-8610A supports 802.1p Quality of Service (QoS) for enhanced throughput and better performance of time-sensitive traffic like VoIP and streaming DSCP. The DWL-8610AP is WMM-certified, so in the event of network congestion, time-sensitive traffic can be given priority ahead of other traffic. Furthermore, when a number of DWL-8610APs are in close proximity with each other, an access point will refuse new association requests once its resources are fully utilized. Instead, the association request will be picked up by a neighboring unit. This feature ensures that no single AP is overburdened while others nearby sit idle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Maximum wireless signal rate derived from IEEE standard 802.11 and draft 802.11ac specifications. Actual data throughput will vary. Network conditions and environmental factors, including volume of network traffic, building materials and construction, and network overhead, lower actual data throughput rate. Environmental factors will adversely affect wireless signal range. <br /> <br /> <sup>2 </sup>This feature is available when Unified AP is used in conjunction with D-Link’s line of Unified Wireless Switches/controllers.</p>

<li>Compact size</li>
<li>Robust metal rackmountable housing</li>
<li>Fanless design for silent operation</li>
<li>Plug-and-play installation</li>
</ul>
<p>Something of a powerhouse when it comes to Power-over-Ethernet switches, this compact beauty offers PoE to 802.3af/at standard across all eight Gigabit Ethernet ports, at up to 30 Watts per port with a power budget total of 140 Watts. Which, put simply, means you can power devices such as access points, IP phones and video surveillance cameras simply by plugging them in with an Ethernet cable – no additional power required.</p>
<p><strong>PoE</strong></p>
<p>The DGS-1008MP features 8 x 10/100/1000BASE-T ports that support the IEEE 802.3at PoE+ protocol. Each of the 8 PoE+ ports can supply up to 30 watts with a total PoE power budget of 140 watts. PoE is especially suitable for devices that are far from power outlets or when you want to minimise the clutter of extra cables.</p>
<p><strong>Superior Performance</strong></p>
<p>No configuration is required and installation is quick and easy. Support for Auto MDI/MDI-X on all ports eliminates the need for crossover cables when connecting to another switch. Auto- Negotiation on each port senses the link speed of a network device (10, 100 or 1000 Mbps) and intelligently adjusts for compatibility and optimal performance. The switch has been designed without fans ensuring silent operation wherever it is installed. With wire-speed filtering and store-and-forward switching, the DGS-1008MP maximises network performance while minimising the transmission of bad network packets.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Saving</strong></p>
<p>DGS-1008MP switches feature both D-Link Green 3.0 Technology and IEEE802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) to cut operating costs without sacrificing operational performance or functionality. With D-Link Green technology, the switches constantly monitor the link status and network utilisation of every port. The switches also automatically detect cable length and can reduce transmission power usage for shorter cables. By pairing EEE capable devices with DGS-1008MP switches organizations can drastically reduce power consumption by automatically putting ports into a sleep mode when not being used. </p>

<p>The DGS-108 8-Port Gigabit Unmanaged Desktop Switch offers an economical way for SOHO and small and medium businesses to benefit from the increased bandwidth of Gigabit Ethernet. It provides eight Gigabit ports for easy expansion of your network and a quick way to upgrade your network to Gigabit connectivity. The DGS-108 is designed with durability and performance in mind. Its sturdy metal housing ensures the product can withstand wider operating by helping to dissipate heat and reduce stress on internal components.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Effortless Gigabit Networking</strong></p>
<p>With data transfer speeds of up to 2000 Mbps on Gigabit Ethernet, the D-Link DGS-108 is ideal for transferring files quickly and online gaming. The DGS-108 features front, easy-to-access Ethernet ports with two colour LED indicators per port to easily distinguish link status. The switch features QoS, which organizes and prioritizes time-sensitive and important data for efficient delivery, allowing for smooth streaming media, VoIP calling, and online gaming. Additionally, the switch features a Kensington Security Slot on the rear panel where users can fasten the unit to a table or desk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Think Green</strong></p>
<p>The DGS-108 is a plug-and-play networking switch that features D-Link’s Green Technology to save energy and reduce heat, which in turn extends product life without sacrificing performance or functionality. The switch supports IEEE 802.3az Energy-Efficient Ethernet (EEE) which can detect when a connected computer is shut down or when there is no Ethernet traffic, and will proceed to power down the idle port, saving a substantial amount of power. In addition, the switch can also save energy by detecting the length of cable connected to a port and use only as much power as is required. Both of these features work together to help you save power automatically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Environmentally Friendly</strong></p>
<p>The switch was designed with the environment in mind. It is compliant with Energy Star Level V, CEC, and MEPS regulations which require the use of energy efficient power adapters. The switch is built to comply with RoHS standards to minimize use of hazardous materials and is packaged with an EnergyStar Level V qualified power adapter in a recyclable packaging making this product truly environmentally friendly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IEEE 802.1p QoS</strong></p>
<p>QoS prioritizes network traffic so that time-sensitive data is delivered efficiently, even during bursts of high data traffic. This helps ensure an optimal experience for streaming media, VoIP calls, and online gaming.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cable Diagnostics Function</strong></p>
<p>The D-Link Cable Diagnostics Function enables users to be instantly aware of cable conditions through the LED display on the front-panel. Users can determine whether the pin connections of their cable connectors are correct, facilitating prompt network troubleshooting if required.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s growing businesses demand and rely more on their network to carry out mission-critical business activities. Companies are putting more network traffic and applications such as VoIP phones and IP cameras on their Ethernet infrastructure. It needs the network intelligence to separate the voice and video traffic from data, and prioritize them accordingly. However, companies do not necessarily have more money or advanced training to deal with complex managed switches. NETGEAR Smart Managed Plus Switches meet this growing need by providing fundamental network features that will help optimize the performance of business networks. On top of the plug-N-play Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, these switches also offer essential networking features such as VLAN, QoS, IGMP Snooping, Link Aggregation / Port Trunking on models with 16 ports or more, rate limiting and traffic monitoring. NETGEAR Smart Managed Plus Switches are an exceptional value for businesses looking to add intelligence to their network beyond what unmanaged switches can provide.</p>
<h4>Prioritize Voice/Video</h4>
<p>With the ability to set up and configure QoS, these Gigabit Smart Managed Plus Switches can detect different types of network traffic and assign the desired priority to latency-sensitive traffic, such as voice and video. This helps improve the delivery quality of related applications such as VoIP, multimedia broadcasting, and video conferencing.</p>
<h4>Build Multiple Network Groups</h4>
<p>These Gigabit Smart Managed Plus Switches can help divide big networks into smaller more manageable groups and have resources dedicated for one or several groups rather than making the same resources open to all. This feature improves overall network performance, adds security to network traffic, and makes more efficient use of network resources.</p>

<p>All Gigabit Smart Managed Plus Switches come with a cable diagnostic feature that enables users to easily find out the health status of their network cables. If there are any problems, this feature helps quickly locate the point where the cabling fails; allowing connectivity issues to be fixed much faster, potentially saving technicians hours of troubleshooting.</p>
<h4>IGMP Snooping for Optimized Multimedia Traffic Delivery</h4>
<p>By listening in on the IGMP conversation between hosts and routers, the Gigabit Smart Managed Plus switch can maintain a map as to which links need which IP multicast streams. The Gigabit Web Managed (Plus) therefore will be able to forward multicast traffic only to the links that have asked for them and cut multicast traffic from links that do not contain a multicast listener.
